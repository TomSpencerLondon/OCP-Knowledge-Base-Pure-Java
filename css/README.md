Free resources
CSS for JavaScript Developers is a premium course, and I recognize that not everyone will be able to afford it. Fortunately, there are plenty of amazing free resources you can use to learn CSS!

Here are some of my favourites:

- The MDN docs are the gold standard. You can learn everything you need to know through the MDN docs alone.

- Google's web.dev recently released a text-based online course, Learn CSS, produced by a superstar team of talented CSS developers.

- The CSS specifications are surprisingly user-friendly! I learned a ton reading the Flexbox spec.
