Exercises

15. Describe the two major components of a computer system:
The first component of a computer system is System software. This includes the operating
systems, system support and system development. The second component of a computer system
is Application Software which includes general purpose and application specific software.

16. Computer hardware is made up of five parts. List and describe them.
The hardware component of a computer system consists of five parts:
First input devices, Second central processing units (CPUs),
Third primary storage, Fourth output devices, and Fifth auxilary storage
devices. Input devices include the keyboard and mouse, The CPU is responsible
for executing instructions as arithmetic calculations, comparisons among data and
movement of data inside the system.
Primary storage, also known as main memory is a place where the programs and data
are stored temporarily during processing. The data in primary storage is erased when
we turn off the personal computer.
Output devices are monitors or printers to show output.
Auxiliary storage also known as secondary storage is used for both input and output.
It is the place where the programs and data are stored permanently. When we turn off the
computer, our programs and data remain in secondary storage.

17. Describe the major differences between a time-sharing and a client server environment.
In a Time-sharing environment many users are connnected to one or more computers. The output
devices are shared by all users.
In a Client/Server environment the computing function is split between a central computer
and users' computers. The users are given computers or workstations so that some of the
computing responsibility can be moved from the central computer and assigned to workstations.
The central computer is powerful and known as the server. Because the work is shared between
users the response time and monitor display are faster and users are more productive.

18. Describe the two major categories of software.
General purpose software and application specific software are the two major categories of
software. The first, general purpose software, is purchased from a software developer and
can often be used for more than one application. Examples could include word processors,
database management systems, computer-aided design systems. The second, application-specific
software can be used only for the intended purpose. For instance, a general ledger system used
by accountants is an example of application specific software.

19. Identify at least two types of system software that you will use when you write programs.
